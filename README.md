# NOBO


a tours web-app using Node js and react.

In the back-end i'm using node js, express and mongo, for testing using postman.
When it'll be done the server will be able to get payments, add additional tours, enable roles like admin or leading guide, authentication and much more~

In the front side i'm using react and styled-components (as you can see i'm building everything by my self using html and (a lot) css/scss).
also using data managment and fetching like redux toolkit, react-redux, react query axios. and to get an illusion of a multy page app using react router.
